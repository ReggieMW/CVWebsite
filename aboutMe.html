    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Working in the foreclosure business for a decade strongly inspired in me two goals: 
        <ul>
            <li>To help other people achieve their goals and dreams</li>
            <li>A desire to create a more equitable world in which everyone has the basic needs to live</li>
        </ul>
        In my professional career, I've been very lucky to manage and mentor many people that have gone on to achieve great things.
        I plan on continuing that support while I work towards achieving my personal goal of making the world a better place. 
        I hope to combine my passion for reading, travel, gaming, and human rights to create software that allows me to share those
        passions with others. 
    </p>

    In my free time I enjoy most of it with my wife and our three dogs. I've always been a voracious reader and student, and 
    read books on what some may find an eclectic mix of subjects, both fiction and non-fiction. I also enjoy playing guitar, 
    video games, and NYT puzzles. I've been fortunate enough to travel to over a dozen foreign countries, including living in 
    Prague, Czech Republic for a year teaching English as a foreign language.
