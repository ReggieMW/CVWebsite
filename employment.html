    <h1>Thesis</h1>
    <p>"To each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." My focus is to dedicate my talents towards
        building communities based in equity and mutual respect. People are happiest and make the most impactful
        contributions
        when they have autonomy over their contribution, end-to-end inclusiveness in the stated endeavor, and have
        concrete
        representation of the impact of their contribution.</p>
